Welcome to the documentation for **Pheno-Ranker-UI**!

!!! Abstract "About" 
    This [documentation](https://cnag-biomedical-informatics.github.io/pheno-ranker) provides instructions and guidelines for installing and using a software tool specifically designed for performing semantic similarity search on JSON|YAML files (and CSV).

!!! Bug "Disclaimer"
    This software is still in development (**beta**) phase. Further testing and refinement are required before it can be considered fully operational. Until then, it is not recommended to use it in any production environments.
