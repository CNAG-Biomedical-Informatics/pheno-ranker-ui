    <h1>Chromium based browsers not yet supported</h1>
    <p>
      We apologize for the inconvenience, but this website does not currently
      support chromium based browsers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please use a different browser such as
      <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> or
      <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> to access this website.

      This is most likely due to ShinyProxy not yet supporting chromium based
      browsers. We have filed an issue to track this problem:
